**Approach** 
As I'm not familiar with go this was originally written in node.js firstly solving the algorthim, and trying to resolve any inital bugs to match the rules outlined in the challenge.

The Node.js code was then translated to Go using material which was available online.
Postman was utilised to ensure the API was working as expected
Front end was added using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

**Extension Activities**
Try to match branding with GymShark and add additional information for the end user, such as wastage, number of packages.
